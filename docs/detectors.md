# Detectors Overview

Here's a list of all the detectors:

- [Branch Duplicate](./detectors/BranchDuplicate.md)
- [Constant Address](./detectors/ConstantAddress.md)
- [Divide before Multiply](./detectors/DivideBeforeMultiply.md) (requires Soufflé)
- [`dump` Is Used](./detectors/DumpIsUsed.md)
- [Field Initialized Twice](./detectors/FieldDoubleInit.md)
- [Never-accessed Variables](./detectors/NeverAccessedVariables.md)
- [Prefer Augmented Assign](./detectors/PreferAugmentedAssign.md)
- [Read-only Variables](./detectors/ReadOnlyVariables.md) (requires Soufflé)
- [String Receivers Overlap](./detectors/StringReceiversOverlap.md)
- [Unbound Loops](./detectors/UnboundLoops.md) (requires Soufflé)
- [Zero Address](./detectors/ZeroAddress.md)

Some of the detectors require [Soufflé](https://souffle-lang.github.io/install) to be installed. If no Soufflé installation is found, these detectors won't be executed.

Each detector is designed to catch specific issues in your code. Click on any of them to learn more.
