Misti is a static analysis tool designed for smart contracts on the [TON blockchain](https://ton.org/).

**Language Support:**

- Support for [FunC](https://docs.ton.org/develop/func/overview) [is planned](https://github.com/nowarp/misti/issues/56).

## Use Cases

Misti is designed to detect issues in smart contracts efficiently, making it ideal for integration into development tools and CI/CD pipelines. By incorporating Misti, you can:

* **Detect Vulnerabilities:** Identify and fix potential security flaws early in the development cycle.
* **Improve Code Quality:** Maintain high standards by catching bugs and enforcing best practices automatically.
* **Streamline Development:** Integrate Misti into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous code quality checks.
* **Custom Detectors:** Create custom detectors to solve specific problems in your code or to provide a thorough security review if you are an auditor.

## Name Origin
The name "Misti" comes from the Misti volcano in Peru. It was chosen because it's catchy and easy to remember.
